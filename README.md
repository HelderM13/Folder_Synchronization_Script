# Folder_Synchronization_Script
This Python program syncs a source folder with a replica folder, ensuring the replica matches the source by copying, updating, or removing files. It creates dummy files if the source is empty and logs all actions in both the console and a log.txt file. The program runs indefinitely, syncing periodically.
